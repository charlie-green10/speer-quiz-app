## Setup
Two commands are supported from the terminal for running the application. Use 'npm run devenv' in the root directory to start the server with nodemon and NODE_ENV=development, use npm start to start the server regularly with NODE_ENV=production.

## Reference 
I used https://github.com/bradtraversy/storybooks as a reference for dynamically rendering handlebars templates and for configuring passport with google-oauth20.
