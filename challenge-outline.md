## Basics
The challenge is to create a small quiz app where users can create and take quizzes. The users should also be able to see some basic stats about their quiz attempts.

Authentication does not need to be complex, a request header with a user id is enough to see which user is making the request.

There are no front-end requirements for this task.


## Requirements
